* Test case for the `incompressibleDarcy` solver: incompressible flow in a porous medium

  - 1D flow under a pressure gradient.
  - Homogeneous permeability.
  - No geochemistry.

  Should yield a uniform velocity field with a value equal to 
  $-\frac{K}{\mu} \Delta P / L$,
  where
  - $K$ is the permeability, specified in the file `constant/porousProperties`,
  - $mu$ is the viscosity, specified in the file `constant/physicalProperties`,
  - $\delta P$ is the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet,
    specified in `0/p`,
  - $L$ is the domain length, specified in `system/blockMesh`.

  If ran without modification, the velocity should be 1e-5 m/s.

  Run the test with `foamCleanCase && foamRunTutorials` and check the value of
  the velocity in `1/U`.
