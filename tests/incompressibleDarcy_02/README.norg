* Test case for the `incompressibleDarcy` solver: incompressible flow in a porous medium

  - 1D flow with prescribed velocity.
  - Homogeneous permeability.
  - No geochemistry.

  Should yield a uniform velocity field with a value equal to the value
  prescribed at the inlet.

  If ran without modification, the velocity should be 1e-5 m/s.

  Run the test with `foamCleanCase && foamRunTutorials` and check the value of
  the velocity in `1/U`.
