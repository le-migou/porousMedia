* Test case for the `darcy` solver: 1D transport of a tracer

  Simulate the advective-dispersive transport of a tracer in a semi-infinite
  porous medium with prescribed concentration at the origin and zero
  concentration at the infinite. Compare the results with the analytical
  solution by Ogata and Banks (1961).

  We emulate a semi-infinite medium by running the simulation over a one metre
  long domain with a zero gradient boundary condition on the right-hand side,
  representing the infinite part, and considering the results only on one-tenth 
  of the domain, on the left hand-side, where the concentration is prescribed.

  Run the test with `foamCleanCase && foamRunTutorials` and check the results
  displayed in the `plot.png` image file.

  Requires `gnuplot`.
