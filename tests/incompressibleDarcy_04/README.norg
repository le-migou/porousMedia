* Test case for the `darcy` solver: flow in a porous medium

  - 1D flow under a pressure gradient.
  - Heterogeneous permeability.
  - No geochemistry.

  The permeability field in `0/K.orig` is modified by the `setFields` command,
  configured in the `system/setFieldsDict` file.

  If ran without modification, the velocity should be 1e-5 m/s.
  (2024-09-20: We are not quite there yet.)

  Run the test with `foamCleanCase && foamRunTutorials` and check the value of
  the velocity in `1/U`. The pressure field along the 1D domain can be
  plotted with:
  @code sh
  gnuplot -p -e 'plot "postProcessing/graphUniform/1/line.xy" w l t "Pressure"'
  @end
